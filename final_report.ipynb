       "\t<tr><td> 1</td><td>Captain George Vancouver</td><td>A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. \r\n",
       "Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.\r\n",
       "An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. \r\n",
       "Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"\r\n",
       "Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".\r\n",
       "Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"\r\n",
       "Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"\r\n",
       "The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.</td><td>Figurative          </td><td>In place          </td><td>Vancouver City Hall  </td><td>453 West 12th Avenue         </td><td>bronze                </td><td>https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=1 </td><td>https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/6dfd36260587f27540709ca506c4e81c</td><td>City of Vancouver</td><td>Mount Pleasant</td><td>North entrance, exterior, in front of stairs                                                           </td><td>{\"coordinates\": [-123.113918, 49.261185], \"type\": \"Point\"}</td><td>Mount Pleasant</td><td>A full figure bronze statue of Captain George Vancouver stands on the north side of City Hall, pointing towards Vancouver harbour and holding a partially open scroll in his left hand.

The others are in Winnipeg and Montreal.  The angel  originally held a full wreath in her upraised hand.

The pole is 30.5m (100ft) high representing one foot for each year of the Province's existence at the time. The original log was a 600 year old red cedar from the Queen Charlotte Islands. At the First Cut Ceremony, Lt. Gov. Frank M. Ross made the first cut into the log. Mungo Martin worked with his nephew Henry Hunt and his son David Martin to complete the pole in seven months. This pole stands in Windsor Great Park in England. The Vancouver pole is an exact duplicate.\" - ibid, Stewart                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Totem pole          </span></td><td>No longer in place</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hadden Park          </span></td><td>Odgen Street &amp; Cypress Street</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>wood                  </span></td><td>https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=26</td><td>https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/de7031d7a62f163e1661715c96e696f6</td><td>City of Vancouver</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Kitsilano     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>North end of Cypress Street                                                                            </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>{\"coordinates\": [-123.1475, 49.277533], \"type\": \"Point\"}  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Kitsilano     </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>\"Each of the ten figures is the crest of one of the ten Kwakwaka'wakw clans representing the mythical ancestry of the clan.

       "\t  1 & Captain George Vancouver & A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about \\$5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. \r\n",
       "Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.\r\n",
       "An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. \r\n",
       "Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"\r\n",
       "Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".\r\n",
       "Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"\r\n",
       "Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for \\$5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps \\$500 for that...\"\r\n",
       "The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was \\$5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost.

       "\t 26 & Centennial Pole (totem)  & \"The original pole was commissioned by the province in 1958 and presented to Queen Elizabeth. The pole is 30.5m (100ft) high representing one foot for each year of the Province's existence at the time. The original log was a 600 year old red cedar from the Queen Charlotte Islands. At the First Cut Ceremony, Lt. Gov. Frank M. Ross made the first cut into the log. Mungo Martin worked with his nephew Henry Hunt and his son David Martin to complete the pole in seven months.

       "|  1 | Captain George Vancouver | A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. \r\n",
       "Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.\r\n",
       "An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. \r\n",
       "Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"\r\n",
       "Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".\r\n",
       "Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"\r\n",
       "Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"\r\n",
       "The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost.

This is one of three identical statues commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1921 to honour their workers who answered the call of \"king and country\" and made the ultimate sacrifice.  The others are in Winnipeg and Montreal.  The angel  originally held a full wreath in her upraised hand. After WW II, the dates of that war were also added to the plaque. | 94  | Maxime Cyr-Morton      | 1921 | 49.28525, -123.111406  |\n",
       "| 26 | Centennial Pole (totem)  | \"The original pole was commissioned by the province in 1958 and presented to Queen Elizabeth. The pole is 30.5m (100ft) high representing one foot for each year of the Province's existence at the time. The original log was a 600 year old red cedar from the Queen Charlotte Islands.

       "1 A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. \\r\\nMarega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.\\r\\nAn interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. \\r\\nMatthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"\\r\\nTownley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".\\r\\nMatthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"\\r\\nTownley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"\\r\\nThe statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.\n",

       "5 \"The original pole was commissioned by the province in 1958 and presented to Queen Elizabeth. The pole is 30.5m (100ft) high representing one foot for each year of the Province's existence at the time. The original log was a 600 year old red cedar from the Queen Charlotte Islands.

This is one of three identical statues commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1921 to honour their workers who answered the call of \"king and country\" and made the ultimate sacrifice.  The others are in Winnipeg and Montreal.  The angel  originally held a full wreath in her upraised hand. After WW II, the dates of that war were also added to the plaque.\n",
