# ECON326_project

This research aims to investigate how the levels of individual socioeconomic status in neighborhoods determine the placement of public art installations within Vancouver. We will apply regression analysis to answer this question, following the regular track for this project. After testing different models, we found that there're positive correlation between income, education attainment and art installation.
